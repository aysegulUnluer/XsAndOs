# XsAndOs

This is a Tic Tac Toe game written in the Swift programming language. In this game, after you've chosen your name, you can play in three different modes.

The first mode is against the device.
The second mode is a two-player mode where you can play with a friend on the same device.
The third mode allows you to connect with another device and play with your friend remotely.

This code is a result of following a tutorial, and I'd like to thank @codewithchris for their contributions.
